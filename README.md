# Digital-Green
### 
A Farmer with an average income has to work a lot every day. They
have to spend hours on the field and then on the market.
Digital green provides solutions to farmerâ€™s day to day problems by
allowing them to buy their equipment online and by also allowing them
to sell their crops online.
This in result will reduce their working hours and will give them more
time to focus on their field work.

### Novelty 
Currently there is no such dedicated platform for farmers.
Digital green will provide farmers a friendly interface where they can buy
their equipment and also sell their crops by following simple steps.
It will help the farmers to save a lot of time as a lot of their market work is
reduced.
This website will also help retailers and wholesalers, as they will be able to
directly buy products from farmers at the best price possible.
